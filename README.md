# transformer-experiments

<!-- WARNING: THIS FILE WAS AUTOGENERATED! DO NOT EDIT! -->

This repo contains experiments I did on the simple transformer developed
in [Andrej Karpathy](https://karpathy.ai/)’s excellent video, [Let’s
build GPT: from scratch, in code, spelled
out](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCc8FmEb1nY). The transformer
architecture, training, and basic inference code comes from that video.
The experiments and analyses are my own.

## Dev Environment Setup

1.  Create a virtual environment

``` bash
python3 -m venv ~/venv/venv-transformer-experiments
source ~/venv/venv-transformer-experiments/bin/activate
```

2.  Install dependencies

``` bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
pip install -r requirements.dev.txt
```

### Before committing any changes

Run the following to ensure all dependencies are generated from
notebooks and notebooks are cleaned:

``` bash
make all
```
